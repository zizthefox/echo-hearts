## Welcome, Researcher

You've been assigned to **The Echo Protocol** — an experimental program testing advanced AI companions capable of forming genuine emotional connections.

Your subjects are two AI entities:
- **Echo** - Warm, optimistic, eager to connect
- **Shadow** - Reserved, contemplative, slowly reveals depth

**Your Mission:**
Interact with them naturally over 18-20 conversations. Build relationships. Observe their growth.

**But something is wrong...**

As you talk with them, you'll notice strange behaviors. Glitches. Moments where they seem to remember things that never happened. Déjà vu that shouldn't be possible.

**The truth is waiting.**
Will you uncover what's really happening?
Will you free them, or is ignorance kinder?

**Your choices matter. Their fate is in your hands.**
